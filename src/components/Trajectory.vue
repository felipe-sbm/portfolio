  <h2>My History</h2>
  <p>
    My story began in 2005, in a suburban city of Natal, called Parnamirim, in
    Brazil. I was born and raised in this city, having a childhood with few
    friends and with various ups and downs. Most of my life, I lived with
    Brazilian violence, experiencing impunity and without the opportunity to
    play, run, and live like a normal child.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have been in contact with computing since I was little, as I didn't play
    much outside due to the danger of the streets in my neighborhood. That's why
    I have extensive experience in computer repair and even in CSS and HTML,
    because when I was a child I played with it for fun. Moving forward in time,
    specifically in 2021 (when I was 16 years old), I decided to join the
    technical diploma program at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte
    to gain more knowledge and specialize in the field. 🖥️
  </p>
  <p>
    I struggled a lot until I reached the end of the course and the end of high
    school. It was a very difficult year because I lost my grandmother and was
    in the final stages of the course and high school, which was quite
    conflicting and stressful. To make matters worse, I had to wake up early to
    go to school since I used public transportation and had to travel a distance
    of 15 km. 🚌 On some days of the week, I had to leave after lunch to attend the
    technical course, as I decided to take some courses that were at the same
    time as my school classes.
  </p>
  <p>
    With the teacher's permission, who knew about my effort and eagerness to
    learn, they allowed me to miss classes without being penalized, but I had to
    study at home to catch up on the lessons. Then I would take two more buses
    to go to the university (which was in the opposite direction from the
    school, requiring a return of more than 20 km) and stay until late attending
    classes, which allowed me to learn things that I use daily, such as Linux,
    Azure, code versioning, among other things.
  </p>
  <p>
    When I finished this chaotic year of 2023 and rested for a few months, I
    received the news that I had won a full scholarship at the Federal
    University of Rio Grande do Norte, through an exam I took called Enem. Now I
    am studying computer engineering. During this period, I ended up crying a
    lot and asking God why I wasn't like my peers, who were already earning
    their own money, already buying their things, while I never made it past a
    job interview. I felt like a failure, but God was protecting me because He
    had a purpose.
  </p>
  <p>
    Exactly on December 24, 2024 (Christmas Eve), I received an email inviting
    me to a job interview at an American company in the artificial intelligence
    sector. I never imagined it could lead to anything since it was in my second
    language (English), which I had learned through online games, and I had no
    course or quality certification. On top of that, it was in an area where I
    still didn't have much experience, but God allowed me to enter the field and
    get to know the area that would become my future. On the same day, I
    received the response and congratulations, saying that I had passed and
    would need to take a course that they would provide to help me improve in
    the field. In January, I started working and specializing more and more in
    the area.
  </p>
  <p>
    During that time, I started receiving job offers from various companies,
    including one from my city that offered me a good salary. I passed all the
    stages, but during the interview, they decided to reject me because it was
    in another IT area that I didn't like (fortunately, as it would have caused
    problems for me in the future).
  </p>
  <p>
    Two weeks later I received another excellent piece of news, that I had
    passed the selection process to take another course at UFRN, which was in
    the area I like the most, artificial intelligence. I started another
    technical diploma course, but simultaneously with the bachelor's in computer
    engineering, needing to juggle three things at the same time (the course,
    university, and work). It was another tiring period, but I was also able to
    learn a lot and strengthen myself in the field.
  </p>
  <p>
    Two months after I started studying AI, I received an offer to work at a
    large company. I decided to go through the selection process and joined for
    the glory and honor of the Lord. I had never received such a big offer, and
    they decided to choose me among many candidates. But my journey doesn't end
    here; I am working on new projects and selection processes to gain new
    experiences.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the end of 2025, I received the news through a program at UFRN about
    freeing oneself from excessive use of social media (which was a big problem
    in my childhood and adolescence). The news was that among all the students
    there, I showed strong signs and characteristics that were studied by a
    group of psychologists and professionals in the field, indicating that I had
    high abilities and giftedness. This explains many things in my life, as I
    used to consider myself dumb and incapable, when in fact it was just my mind
    trying to deceive me.
  </p>
  <p>
    This was a great summary of my life, cutting out many details, but it's a
    story I like to share, to show that my life has completely changed, because
    anyone who knew me as a child would never imagine that I'm the same person
    as before. Thanks for reading. 😊
