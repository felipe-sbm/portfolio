## Overview

Legacy is an open-source learning platform designed to teach logical reasoning and problem solving through procedurally generated exercises. Each session produces a unique set of logic and math problems, so every playthrough is different and tailored to keep learners engaged.

Built with SvelteKit, Svelte and Bun, Legacy prioritizes speed and responsiveness. The app was designed with pedagogy in mind: short, varied challenges, immediate feedback, and gentle difficulty progression help users learn without feeling overwhelmed. Gamification elements—such as scoring, streaks, and friendly competition—are used to increase motivation and sustain engagement.

In this project, I was the open source director, managing all the code and issues created by the programmers, and I also contributed directly to changes in the frontend, UI/UX development, and the composition of sound effects through orchestration in MuseScore 4.

Key features:

- Procedural problem generation for logic and mathematics (unique sessions each time)
- Adaptive difficulty and varied question formats to reinforce learning
- Fast, server-rendered interface using SvelteKit and Bun
- Gamified UX with points, streaks and leaderboards to encourage practice
- Open-source and extensible: easy to contribute new problem types or game modes

Legacy aims to make learning logic fun, accessible and effective by combining strong pedagogical design with modern, high-performance web tooling.
