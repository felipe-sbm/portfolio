    title: 'My History',
    "paragraphs": [
      "My story began in 2005, in a suburban city of Natal, called Parnamirim, in Brazil. I was born and raised in this city, having a childhood with few friends and with various ups and downs. Most of my life, I lived with Brazilian violence, experiencing impunity and without the opportunity to play, run, and live like a normal child.",
      "I have been in contact with computing since I was little, as I didn't play much outside due to the danger of the streets in my neighborhood. That's why I have extensive experience in computer repair and even in CSS and HTML, because when I was a child I played with it for fun. Moving forward in time, specifically in 2021 (when I was 16 years old), I decided to join the technical diploma program at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte to gain more knowledge and specialize in the field. 🖥️",
      "I struggled a lot until I reached the end of the course and the end of high school. It was a very difficult year because I lost my grandmother and was in the final stages of the course and high school, which was quite conflicting and stressful. To make matters worse, I had to wake up early to go to school since I used public transportation and had to travel a distance of 15 km. 🚌 On some days of the week, I had to leave after lunch to attend the technical course, as I decided to take some courses that were at the same time as my school classes.",
      "With the teacher's permission, who knew about my effort and eagerness to learn, they allowed me to miss classes without being penalized, but I had to study at home to catch up on the lessons. Then I would take two more buses to go to the university (which was in the opposite direction from the school, requiring a return of more than 20 km) and stay until late attending classes, which allowed me to learn things that I use daily, such as Linux, Azure, code versioning, among other things.",
      "When I finished this chaotic year of 2023 and rested for a few months, I received the news that I had won a full scholarship at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, through an exam I took called Enem. Now I am studying computer engineering. During this period, I ended up crying a lot and asking God why I wasn't like my peers, who were already earning their own money, already buying their things, while I never made it past a job interview. I felt like a failure, but God was protecting me because He had a purpose.",
      "Exactly on December 24, 2024 (Christmas Eve), I received an email inviting me to a job interview at an American company in the artificial intelligence sector. I never imagined it could lead to anything since it was in my second language (English), which I had learned through online games, and I had no course or quality certification. On top of that, it was in an area where I still didn't have much experience, but God allowed me to enter the field and get to know the area that would become my future. On the same day, I received the response and congratulations, saying that I had passed and would need to take a course that they would provide to help me improve in the field. In January, I started working and specializing more and more in the area.",
      "During that time, I started receiving job offers from various companies, including one from my city that offered me a good salary. I passed all the stages, but during the interview, they decided to reject me because it was in another IT area that I didn't like (fortunately, as it would have caused problems for me in the future).",
      "Two weeks later I received another excellent piece of news, that I had passed the selection process to take another course at UFRN, which was in the area I like the most, artificial intelligence. I started another technical diploma course, but simultaneously with the bachelor's in computer engineering, needing to juggle three things at the same time (the course, university, and work). It was another tiring period, but I was also able to learn a lot and strengthen myself in the field.",
      "Two months after I started studying AI, I received an offer to work at a large company. I decided to go through the selection process and joined for the glory and honor of the Lord. I had never received such a big offer, and they decided to choose me among many candidates. But my journey doesn't end here; I am working on new projects and selection processes to gain new experiences.",
      "At the end of 2025, I received the news through a program at UFRN about freeing oneself from excessive use of social media (which was a big problem in my childhood and adolescence). The news was that among all the students there, I showed strong signs and characteristics that were studied by a group of psychologists and professionals in the field, indicating that I had high abilities and giftedness. This explains many things in my life, as I used to consider myself dumb and incapable, when in fact it was just my mind trying to deceive me.",
      "This was a great summary of my life, cutting out many details, but it's a story I like to share, to show that my life has completely changed, because anyone who knew me as a child would never imagine that I'm the same person as before. Thanks for reading. 😊"
